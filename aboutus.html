		<h2>About Our Site</h2>
			<p><h3>A.</h3>This website was made with the intention of making new customers and allowing customers to use our services much faster. The websites purpose is to promote the services provided by the company. All the while putting out name and contact information in places that are easily accessable. This way any new potential customers and existing customers can reach us easily. In order to do this we display a table on our ‘bait prices’ page that shows the daily bait price. Also we created a form on our ‘delivery’ page which allows customers to fill-out, and submit an order. This way customers that are busy and on-the-go can quickly fill their needs with our services.</p><br />

			<p><h4>B.</h4>I wanted the website to put off a marine theme so that customers can tell without any information that we are a marine fishing company. I also wanted all the pages to have the same layout and color scheme so that the whole site looks uniform and flows together. With the background that I chose there were a lot of dark spots that required me to add a background color inside the body in order for the text and information to be readable. I decided to make the white background a little bit see-through so that the background image could be seen in its entirety. I also didn’t want the white background to take over the page and look to plain. At the same time the white allows the information on each page to pop out and capture the customers eye.</p><br />

			<p>On the ‘delivery’ page I changed the color of the input box to make them pop and bring the viewer to the forms in order to fill them out. I’ve also put the company logo and name on all 5 pages for more branding and allowed for the table that shows the bait prices to be updated externally by someone from the company. This way customers are viewing the most up-to-date information and prices the company is offering. I also tried to keep the pages simple and informative in order to make navigation and use of the website easy.</p><br />

			<p><h5>C.</h5>One thing that I would like to do with the website is add more content such as photo galleries from the company. And also add a webcam video which customers would be able to view a live camera feed of a near-by harbor. Another thing I would have liked to do would have been adding an estimated shipping cost, or even an estimated delivery time aspect to the website. While also embedding a google map in order to show customers where the store location is and get directions.</p><br />

			<p>Another aspect that I would have liked to add to the website would be sending the customer information from the forms to an actual invoice and a store database so that returning customers could be remembered. I felt that because I didn’t have lots of image or video embedding within the website made it a bit simple and would have looked a lot more full if there was more information and content to add.</p>
